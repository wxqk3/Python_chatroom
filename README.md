# Python_chatroom
Python_chatroom_project.  <br/>
The client program provides commands: 
login (allow users to join the chat room),  <br/>
send (unicast or broadcast a message; actually send the message to the server and the server forwards the message),  <br/>
logout (quit the chat room), and  <br/>
who (list all the clients in the chat room). <br/>
The server runs a chat room service, manages all the clients and distributes the messages. <br/>
