# Python_chatroom
Python_chatroom_project. 
The client program provides commands: login (allow users to join the chat room), send (unicast or broadcast a message; actually send the message to the server and the server forwards the message), logout (quit the chat room), and who (list all the clients in the chat room). 
The server runs a chat room service, manages all the clients and distributes the messages.
